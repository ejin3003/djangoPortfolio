                    I do a lot of material testing at work, and the software packages I used were not cutting it. I couldn't trust the results they gave me, so I was manually checking each frequency band for every recording, and this took hours. I couldn't find an existing Python program to do what I wanted, so I cobbled together something that automates most of this process, and now the testing is at least 10x faster.
